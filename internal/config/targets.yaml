# Cleanup Targets
#
# safety:
#   safe     - auto-regenerated (caches, logs)
#   moderate - may need re-download or re-login
#   risky    - may contain important data, default unselected
#
# method:
#   trash     - move to Trash (recoverable)
#   permanent - delete immediately (rm -rf)
#   command   - run shell command (requires 'command' field)
#   builtin   - use built-in scanner (docker, homebrew only)
#   manual    - user must delete manually (shows 'guide' in UI)
